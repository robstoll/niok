# Niok - java.nio.file for Kotlin

Niok provides a Kotlin idiomatic API for java.nio.file (the package for non-blocking I/O file operations).
We believe that using `Files` decreases readability => extension functions to the rescue üòè

Next to providing delegations to `Files` it also delegates to Kotlin's built-in extension functions for `File` and
provides additional functions.

# Installation

Niok is published to maven central. Following an example how to use it

```
repositories { mavenCentral() }
dependencies {
    implementation("ch.tutteli.niok:niok:1.4.3")
}
```
